# acme-poller
Secure side poller


## Usage

Runs can be retrieved from the poller by submitting an HTTP get request with a status query. The poller currently supports the following statuses: 
* **new** (Returns every job with a status of 'new')
* **in_progress** (Returns every job with a status of 'in_progress')
* **complete** (Returns every job with a status of 'complete')
* **failed** (Returns every job with a status of 'failed')
* **next** (Returns only the oldest job with the status of new)
* **all** (Returns every job currently known to the poller)

Example URL: `http://127.0.0.1/poller/?status=next`

The response is encoded in JSON format and has the following fields:

* id 
* user
* runspec
* casename
* mppwidth
* stop_option
* stop_n
* walltime
* mach
* compset
* res
* project
* compiler

Updating the status of a run in the poller is done via an HTTP POST request. The poller current expects that a post request will contain a CSRF Token, the id of the run being updated and the new status as a string. The CSRF token can be retrieved at the /poller/ base path. Due to the nature of the Django CSRF token, the 'Referer' header should also be set for any post requests. A 503 status code will be sent if Django can not validate the request. For example usage please refer to the poller.py example file. 

## Error Checking

The poller attempts to send back appropriate HTTP status codes. A status of 200 indicates a successful interaction, but be aware that a response of 200 does not imply that a run existed to send back. Response contents may be empty.
